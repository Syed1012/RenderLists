# React + Vite

# Rendering List 

- implemented List of items using map function of js  example -->

- for proper understanding open the List.jsx file

# Converting Array of string into Array of objects.

- see List2_Objects.jsx file in that we have fruits variable with objects stored.
- we have given a unique id as key or it is giving error in the console.
- we have attached the calories correspondingly 

- Then we have also done sorting based on aplhabetical order and reverse aplhabetical order.

- Then we sorted them by calories asc and desc order both.
